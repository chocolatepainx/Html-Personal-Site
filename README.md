# Html-Personal-Site

After 5 years I just want to re-learn the basics and build a simple site to showcase who I've become. This is a straight simple HTML/CSS website, with some bootstrap and JavaScript. Will publish to heroku. 

## index.html

```bash
Created a basic skeleton to showcase the fundamentals of HTML
```

## style.css

```bash
Add my own twist of design and styling fundamentals for the website 
```
